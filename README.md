# Anomaly-Detection-based-on-Computing-Intelligence
Capstone project Engineering

Anomaly Detection based on Computing Intelligence, research project in which different ML algorithms were implied on stacking model at different levels (level 0, level 1) to achieve higher accuracy rates compared to that of the normal anomaly detection methodologies. The performance of these methods is quite comparable, with nave bayes being the most effective when retained at level 1, followed by support vector machine, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor when kept at level 0.
